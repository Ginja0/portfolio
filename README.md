#Software Design Document
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The prompt was that a gaming room client wanted to make a game that had images that would draw an image were teams would have to guess what was being drawn. 
This game was required to run on browser and be multiplayer. 
I did really well at researching each browser and the percentage of users that would be reached by electing one browser or another. 
If I could revise one thing it would be would be the system archtecture part. I did not do a great job at reviewing that. 
I interpreted the needs of the client pretty well. It is important to interpret the needs of the client because the software is made for the client.
The client needs to be happy to continue doing business together. 
The most important part of a software document is to analyze the needs of the client and see possible constraints, then decide what is best to the client and make the recommendations.

#Software Design Document

The prompt was that a client named Gaming room wanted to make a game called "Draw it or lose it" that had images that would draw an image were teams would have to guess what was being drawn. 
This game was required to run on browser and be multiplayer. 
I did really well at researching each browser and the percentage of users that would be reached by electing one browser or another. 
If I could revise one thing it would be would be the system archtecture part. I did not do a great job at reviewing that. 
I interpreted the needs of the client pretty well. It is important to interpret the needs of the client because the software is made for the client.
The client needs to be happy to continue doing business together. 
The most important part of a software document is to analyze the needs of the client and see possible constraints, then decide what is best to the client and make the recommendations.
